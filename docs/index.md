Welcome to the Cognito Simulation Engine documentation - a revolutionary framework for modeling and testing advanced AI cognitive architectures.

## üß† What is Cognito Simulation Engine?

Cognito Simulation Engine is a modular, production-ready Python framework designed specifically for AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) research. It provides sophisticated tools for simulating cognitive processes that go beyond traditional neural networks, including:

- **Advanced Memory Systems**: Working memory, episodic memory, and long-term memory with realistic cognitive constraints
- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Rule-based inference engines with forward/backward chaining capabilities  
- **Goal-Directed Behavior**: Sophisticated goal planning and achievement tracking
- **Metacognitive Agents**: Self-reflective AI that reasons about its own cognitive processes
- **Interactive Environments**: Rich simulation environments for agent testing and development

## üåü Key Features

### Biologically-Inspired Architecture

- Miller's 7¬±2 working memory capacity limits
- Realistic memory decay and consolidation processes
- Attention-based cognitive resource allocation
- Multi-modal perception and action systems

### Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

- Forward and backward chaining inference
- Abductive reasoning for hypothesis generation
- Uncertainty handling and confidence tracking
- Domain-specific knowledge integration

### Multiple Agent Architectures

- **CognitiveAgent**: Full-featured cognitive architecture
- **ReasoningAgent**: Specialized for logical problem-solving
- **LearningAgent**: Focused on adaptive learning and skill acquisition  
- **MetaCognitiveAgent**: Advanced self-reflective capabilities

### Research-Ready Tools

- Comprehensive performance metrics and analysis
- Configurable simulation parameters
- Data export and visualization capabilities
- Command-line interface for batch processing

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from cognito_sim_engine import CognitiveEngine, CognitiveAgent, CognitiveEnvironment
from cognito_sim_engine import Goal, Fact, SimulationConfig

# Create environment and configuration
env = CognitiveEnvironment("Research Lab")
config = SimulationConfig(max_cycles=100, enable_metacognition=True)

# Create cognitive engine and agent
engine = CognitiveEngine(config=config, environment=env)
agent = CognitiveAgent("researcher_01", "Dr. Cognitive")

# Add agent to environment
env.add_agent("researcher_01")

# Define a research goal
goal = Goal(
    description="Understand cognitive architectures",
    priority=0.8,
    target_facts=[Fact("understood", ["cognitive_architectures"])]
)
agent.add_goal(goal)

# Run simulation
metrics = engine.run_simulation()
print(f"Simulation completed: {metrics.goals_achieved} goals achieved")
```
